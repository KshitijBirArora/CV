      <p>I am a third year student currently studying in <strong>University Of Wollongong</strong> <br>
        my strength is that i am very curious i believe that everything has a reason behind it and i strive always to find the reason before adopting anything
        <br>that is also the reason why i chose this course is also to challenge myself from having minimal background in computer science <br>
        <em><q>i truly believe that its never too late, and starting at any point is better than not starting at all
            which is why i have also taken this course on web development to learn and achieve more.</q></em>
